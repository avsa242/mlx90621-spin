# mlx90621-spin
---------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 driver object for Melexis's MLX90621 16x4 IR sensing array

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Videos

* [P2 VGA-based demo](https://youtu.be/9pcsTAazFpA)

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 1MHz (P2/SPIN2: TBD)
* Single Pixel, Line, Column or whole frame retrieval to buffer
* Continuous or step measure mode
* Set sensor ADC resolution (15..18 bits)
* Set sensor framerate (0.5..512Hz)

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* P1/SPIN1: 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C engine

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1 OpenSpin (bytecode): Untested (deprecated)
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (bytecode): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (nu-code): FTBFS, tested with 5.9.7-beta~~
* P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Very early in development - may malfunction, or outright fail to build
* The sensor has a built-in EEPROM, which unfortunately has the same (fixed) slave address as the EEPROM on most any Propeller 1-based board, so the sensor must be connected to pins other than the "standard" Propeller I2C pins 28 & 29, or the Propeller must be booted by some method other than EEPROM (doesn't apply to P2)
* No correction is performed on the sensor data (i.e., Ta and To; ambient temperature and object temperature). Only the raw image data is collected and returned
